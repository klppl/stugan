# The server

`internal/server` is the HTTP + WebSocket front end. It serves the built
client, bridges each browser session to the right user's `core.Engine` over the
typed wire protocol ([protocol.md](protocol.md)), and provides the auxiliary
HTTP endpoints (auth, uploads, previews, push). It imports `core`, `proto`, and
`auth`, but never girc or Lua.

## Routes

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `/ws` | GET | WebSocket upgrade; resolves the user, sends `hello`+`init`, then streams frames |
| `/api/login` | POST | username/password → sets `stugan_session` cookie |
| `/api/logout` | POST | invalidates the session |
| `/api/me` | GET | reports auth state (enabled, authenticated, user, magic-word grant) |
| `/api/magicword` | POST | site-wide password gate → sets `stugan_magic` cookie |
| `/api/magicword/logout` | POST | clears the magic cookie |
| `/api/preview` | GET | fetch a URL and return Open Graph metadata |
| `/api/proxy` | GET | proxy a remote image/video (hides client IP, avoids mixed content) |
| `/api/upload` | POST | multipart upload → stored file URL |
| `/uploads/*` | GET | serve uploaded files (with `nosniff` + restrictive CSP) |
| `/api/push/vapid` | GET | VAPID public key for push subscription |
| `/api/push/subscribe` | POST | store a browser push subscription |
| `/healthz` | GET | health check |
| `/` | GET | static SPA assets (`client/dist`, configurable) |

## c2s routing

`route()` switches on `Envelope.T` and calls into the user's engine:

| `t` | engine call |
|-----|-------------|
| `msg:send` | `SendInput` (alias → plugin command → built-in → IRC) |
| `backlog:fetch` | history `Backlog` / `BacklogAround` |
| `search` | history `Search` (FTS5) |
| `net:add` | `AddNetworkLive` |
| `net:edit` | `UpdateNetwork` |
| `net:remove` | `RemoveNetwork` |
| `net:connect` | `SetConnected` |
| `net:info` | replies `net:info` with `NetworkConfig` |
| `typing` / `react` / `redact` | `SendTyping` / `SendReaction` / `SendRedact` |
| `list` | `ListChannels` |

## s2c fan-out — `userSink`

Each user has a `userSink` registered on their engine. It implements
`core.Sink` by marshaling committed events to wire frames and broadcasting them
to every browser attached to that user (`routeToUser`):

| Sink method | frame |
|-------------|-------|
| `Print` | `msg` (`MessageDTO`) |
| `NetworkChanged` | `net:update` (`NetworkDTO`) |
| `NetworkRemoved` | `net:remove` |
| `Typing` | `typing` (with `nick`) |
| `React` | `react` (with `nick`) |
| `Redact` | `redact` (with `by`) |
| `ChannelList` | `list:result` |

On connect, the same sink replays a `hello` + a full `init` snapshot so the
client starts from authoritative state.

## Multi-tenancy — the Hub

The `server.Hub` is the seam between a connection and a user's engine:

```go
type Hub interface {
    AuthEnabled() bool
    Login(username, password string) (token string, ok bool)
    Session(token string) (userID string, ok bool)
    StartSession(userID string) (token string, maxAgeSec int)
    EndSession(token string)
    Tenant(userID string) (*Tenant, bool)   // *core.Engine + History
    Users() []string
}

type Tenant struct { Engine *core.Engine; History History }
```

A `/ws` connection resolves its user from the `stugan_session` cookie, or — when
auth is disabled — the implicit `default` user. The concrete hub is built in
`cmd/stugan` over the per-user engines/stores.

## Authentication (`internal/auth`)

- **`Users`** — a `username → bcrypt hash` map. `Verify` is constant-time and
  hashes against a dummy entry for unknown usernames to avoid a timing
  side-channel.
- **`Sessions`** — opaque random tokens (32 bytes, base64) with a TTL.
  `Create` / `Lookup` / `Delete`.
- **Cookies** — `stugan_session` (per-user) and `stugan_magic` (site gate),
  both `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, `Secure` under TLS. Session lifetime is
  configurable (`[auth] session_hours`, default 30 days).

Generate a password hash with `stugan -hashpw` (reads stdin, prints a bcrypt
hash for a `[[users]]` `password_hash`).

## Security hardening

- **Site-wide password gate.** Setting `STUGAN_WEB_PASSWORD` puts a
  single-shared-password prompt in front of `/ws`, `/api/*`, and `/uploads/*`.
  The password is bcrypt-hashed in memory at startup (plaintext never
  retained); a grant lives in `stugan_magic` for 30 days. Stacks with
  `[[users]]` (magic word first, then per-user login).
- **Rate limiting.** `/api/login` and `/api/magicword` are limited per source
  IP (a sliding window, ~8 fails/minute); failures answer after a short delay.
  The login/magic-word forms carry honeypot inputs that trip form-filling bots.
- **SSRF guard.** `/api/preview` and `/api/proxy` use a guarded dialer that
  refuses private/loopback/link-local addresses, an 8s timeout, a redirect cap,
  and a response size cap (~10 MB for the proxy).
- **Upload safety.** Uploaded files get a random name + sanitized extension and
  are served with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and a `default-src 'none'`
  CSP so they can't execute as pages.

## Auxiliary services

- **Link previews (`previews.go`)** — fetch a URL, extract `og:title` /
  `og:description` / `og:image` (falling back to `<title>`/meta description),
  return JSON, cache for an hour.
- **Image/video proxy (`fetch.go`, `previews.go`)** — stream remote media back
  through the daemon to hide the client IP and avoid mixed-content warnings.
- **Uploads (`uploads.go`)** — multipart `POST /api/upload` → a served
  `/uploads/<random>.<ext>` URL.
- **Web Push (`push.go`)** — a VAPID keypair (persisted under the data dir) and
  per-user subscriptions. When a highlight arrives for a user with no attached
  browser, a push is sent; dead subscriptions are pruned on 404/410.

## Verifying changes

There is no mock IRC server. The established way to verify end-to-end behavior
is to run the daemon against Libera (`irc.libera.chat:6697`, TLS) with a random
nick in a low-traffic channel, then drive it with a throwaway Node WebSocket
client (`ws://127.0.0.1:8080/ws`) that sends/reads `proto` frames. The package
tests themselves use `httptest` + `coder/websocket` Dial against an in-process
engine with a `fakeConn`.
